      Hi, my name is Elizabeth Serrano. I currently attend Kennesaw State University (2024), 
      where I am pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Software Engineering. 
      Before transferring to Kennesaw State, I spent two years at Georgia Southern University, 
      where I was involved in student life there. During my time there, I served as a public representative 
      for the Latin Club, helping bring awareness to the organization. At KSU, I continue to expand 
      my academic and professional interests by participating in organizations such as the Society 
      of Women Engineers. I plan to graduate in June 2026 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
